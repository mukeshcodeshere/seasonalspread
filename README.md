## 📁 Step 3: Navigate to Your Documents Folder

Before cloning the repository, navigate to your **Documents** folder where you want to store the project.

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt** (on Windows) or your **terminal** (on macOS/Linux).
2. Run the following command to go to your Documents folder:

   **For Windows:**

   ```bash
   cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents
   ```

   git clone https://github.com/mukeshcodeshere/seasonalspread.git

## 🐍 Step 5: Create & Activate Your Python Environment

conda create --name work python=3.13.2
conda activate work
```

This sets up a clean Python environment named `work`.

## 📦 Step 6: Install Project Dependencies

Make sure you're inside the `seasonalspread` folder, then install the required dependencies by running:

```

 ## Step 7: Environment Variable Setup Instructions

### 🔐 Environment Variables Setup

To securely store and use sensitive credentials (like database connection info), create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.

**Steps:**

1. Create a `credential.env` file in the 'seasonalspread' folder.
 
2. Add the following content to the `credential.env` file (replace values as needed):

```env
DB_SERVER=XXX - DB login item
DB_NAME=XXX - DB login item
DB_USERNAME=XXX - DB login item
DB_PASSWORD=XXX - DB login item
USERNAME_LOGIN=XXX - MV login item
PASSWORD_LOGIN=XXX - MV login item
GvWSUSERNAME=GCC018 - GvWS login item
GvWSPASSWORD=password - GvWS login item
reference_schemaName= SQL Table
future_expiry_table_Name= SQL Table
tradepricetable= SQL Table
contract_margin_table= SQL Table
query = SQL QUERY
```

3. **Do not upload or commit this credential.env file** 

The application will automatically load these environment variables at runtime using `python-dotenv`.

## ▶️ Step 7: Run the Application

To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python dash_launcher.py

### 🔴 To Stop the Application
