## üìÅ Step 3: Navigate to Your Documents Folder

Before cloning the repository, navigate to your **Documents** folder where you want to store the project.

1. Open **Anaconda Prompt** (on Windows) or your **terminal** (on macOS/Linux).
2. Run the following command to go to your Documents folder:

   **For Windows:**

   ```bash
   cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents
   ```

   **For macOS/Linux:**

   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents
   ```

This ensures that the project is stored in your **Documents** folder.

## üìÇ Step 4: Clone the Project Repository

Now that you're in your **Documents** folder:

1. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mukeshcodeshere/gcc_dash_spread.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd gcc_dash_spread
   ```

   The project will now be stored in your **Documents** folder, inside the `gcc_dash_spread` directory.

## üêç Step 5: Create & Activate Your Python Environment

In Anaconda Prompt (or terminal), run these commands to create and activate a new environment:

```bash
conda create --name work python=3.13.2
conda activate work
```

This sets up a clean Python environment named `work`.

## üì¶ Step 6: Install Project Dependencies

Make sure you're inside the `gcc_dash_spread` folder, then install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---
 ## Step 7: Environment Variable Setup Instructions

### üîê Environment Variables Setup

To securely store and use sensitive credentials (like database connection info), create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.

**Steps:**

1. Create a `credential.env` file in the 'gcc_dash_spread' folder.
 
2. Add the following content to the `credential.env` file (replace values as needed):

```env
DB_SERVER=XXX - DB login item
DB_NAME=XXX - DB login item
DB_USERNAME=XXX - DB login item
DB_PASSWORD=XXX - DB login item
USERNAME_LOGIN=XXX - MV login item
PASSWORD_LOGIN=XXX - MV login item
GvWSUSERNAME=GCC018 - GvWS login item
GvWSPASSWORD=password - GvWS login item
```

3. **Do not upload or commit this credential.env file** 

The application will automatically load these environment variables at runtime using `python-dotenv`.
